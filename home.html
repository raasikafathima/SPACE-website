DoSISRO has been providing Launch services for customer satellites since 1999 onboard 
ISRO’s Polar Satellite Vehicle (PSLV). Till June 2019, 319 customer satellites from 33 countries
 have been launched onboard PSLV on commercial basis through its commercial arm . 
In September 2016, PSLV C-37 has successfully injected 104 satellites into orbit 
– the highest number of satellites launched in a single mission so far. 
PSLV is a versatile vehicle, capable of launching satellites into LEO (Low Earth Orbit) 
, SSO, Sub-GTO, GTO (Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit) 
Orbits. With ISRO operationalising
 its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and LVM3 and building Small Satellite 
 Launch Vehicle (SSLV), as a launch on demand Vehicle, NSIL is in a position to offer and 
 expand its launch services.
