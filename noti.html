<pre>Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system and the eighth
     in size and mass. 
    Its closeness to the Sun and its smallness make it the most 
    elusive of the planets visible to the unaided eye.
     Because its rising or setting is always within about 
     two hours of the Sun’s,
     it is never observable when the sky is fully dark.
      Mercury is designated by the symbol ☿.</pre>
